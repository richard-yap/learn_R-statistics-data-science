# learn_R-statistics-data-science

Script written by me in RStudio covers all the basics of R and covers the tidyverse library in R:
including GGplot2, Dplyr, Tidyr, etc for data wrangling and manipulation for data analysis.

Also learnt statistical methods and how you can do hypothesis testing and plot linear regression models for example using R.
